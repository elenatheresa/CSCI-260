      For courses in Human-Computer Interaction The Sixth Edition of
      Designing the User Interface provides a comprehensive, authoritative, and 
      up-to-date introduction to the dynamic field of and user experience design. 
      This classic book has defined and charted the
      astonishing evolution of user interfaces for three decades. Students and 
      professionals learn practical principles and guidelines needed to develop high 
      quality interface designs that users can understand, predict, and control. The book 
      covers theoretical foundations and design processes such as expert reviews and 
      usability testing. By presenting current research and innovations in human-computer 
      interaction, the authors strive to inspire students, guide designers, and provoke 
      researchers to seek solutions that improve the experiences of novice and expert users, 
      while achieving universal usability. The authors also provide balanced 
      presentations on controversial topics such as augmented and virtual reality, voice 
      and natural language interfaces, and information visualization. Updates include 
      current HCI design methods, new design examples, and totally revamped coverage of 
      social media, search and voice interaction. Major revisions were made to EVERY 
      chapter, changing almost every figure (170 new color figures) and substantially 
      updating the references.
